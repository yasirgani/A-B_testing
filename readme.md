## Dataset

> This dataset was provided by Udacity as part of their Data Analyst nanodegree program. The data consisted of results from a fictional e-commerce website, testing whether the 'conversion' rate of their customers improved with the aid of a new website.

> The following libraries were used to complete this project in Jupyter Notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- random


## Summary of Findings

> Statistical analysis was used to determine whether the results from the A/B test followed that the new website outperformed the old website.
> Bootstrapped samples of data were used to analyse the results, failing to reject the null hypothesis that the old website performed at least as well as the new website, if not better.
> Logisstic regression was then used to confirm the findings.
